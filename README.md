# Hover-zoom module
Position-independent hover-zoom module

See demo here: https://www.cunninghamwebdd.com/demo/hover-zoom/

## Summary
This is a simple hover-zoom module that you can place anywhere on a page. The aspect-ratio of the images are designed to be 1:1
since the containers are of 1:1 aspect-ratio.

The larger image should be 5 times larger than the smaller image. The smaller image having preferrably a height/width dimension of 
300px by 300px.

### Note
This is only intended to be used on non-touch screen devices eg. devices with a mouse, as the tracking does not work well on 
touch-based devices like a phone.

This requires jQuery and may be dependent on the use of a css-reset/setting the body to have padding: none; and border: 0;
